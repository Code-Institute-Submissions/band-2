                    <p>… begins in 1977 when the first Pipe band at all in northern Germany was founded in Hamburg under the name of "Die Sackpfeifen". This laid the foundation for an ever-evolving Pipe scene. The band was built-up and also branched out
                        and carries the name "Hamburg Caledonian Pipes and Drums" since 2008. Since then the band has been a non-profit organisation and since the beginning of 2017 also a registered association. Our name shows the connectivity with our
                        hometown Hamburg as well as with Scotland because "Caledonia" comes from the Roman name for what is now Scotland. Our members come from Hamburg and its surroundings. Our tartan is Ancient Caledonian.</p>

                    <p>In the early 1980s Alan Campell from Scotland and Alan Eaton from Canada showed some enthusiastic boys from Hamburg the first steps on the practice chanter and bagpipes. Later there were contacts with the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards,
                        who were stationed in Fallingbostel, Lower Saxony. At that time Pipe Major John Bruce and his successor Pipe Major Bryon Brotherton were teaching the band. In the mid 1990s, some members of the Hamburg Caledonian Pipes & Drums re-established contacts with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada Pipes and Drums, Princess Louise´s. Some of the Canadians lived in Germany temporarily. During that time, there were performances in Germany, the Netherlands and in Belgium. The highlight was the participation in the World Pipe band Championships in Glasgow. Up to the 2000s there were also performances at the "Bundeskanzlerfest" (Federal Chancellor´s Festival) in Bonn, the “Europafest”
                        in Erfurt, in Wurzen, Pfalz, Leipzig trade fair, at the "Kieler Woche" and the Hamburg Police show. In the years 1997 and 1999 we played together with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada Pipes and Drums, Princess Louise´s at the Police show. Some HCPD members played – as representatives of the City of Hamburg – at the Canadian International Military Tattoo in Hamilton, Ontario. The whole band participated at the Canadian Military Tattoo in the years
                        2001,2002, 2004, 2007 and 2010.</p>

                    <p>Since than a lot happened: life changes, members leave the band, new members join. A new generation of musicians is growing, new and different contacts are emerging. Since 2010 we are emerging from a change of generation that strengthens
                        us and the band is growing. The Hamburg Caledonian Pipes & Drums are playing at different private and public Events in the north German area nowadays. Since 2008 we are very happy to be part of events like "Movimento" in Norderstedt, Schleswig-Holstein, at the "Eulenfest" in Quickborn, Schleswig-Holstein, at the "Irish im Koog" in Westerdeichstrich or at the "Kulturnacht" in Friedrichstadt, just to name a few, which we are playing every year. We also like to
                        be guest at Highland Games, where we like to accompany Scottish sports with our Scottish music. So far, we have also had a lot of fun on charity events like the Starpyramide in Hamburg-Harburg or on the 25th anniversary of “Appen musiziert” in 2015.</p>
                    <p>There are also unique opportunities, in 2013, when we had the honor to lead the delegation of British Isles & Ireland to the Parade on the occasion of the 96th Lions Club International Convention around the Binnenalster lake in Hamburg.
                        As one of the 27 music groups from Germany, we took part in a competition during the parade and won the second place (music and general expression / marching and manoeuvring). In 2017 we had another unique opportunity, when we had been invited to Sonderborg, Danmark where we were asked to play our music for the biggest Ring Riding Festival in Northern Europe. One unforgettable moment was a joint concert with the Band of the Irish Guards. At the end of 2017 and beginning of 2018 we joined the massed bands for Tattoos in Berlin and Bremen. Since 2010 we start our musical year at the end of January, with a Burns Night Supper in Kayhude, Schleswig-Holstein near Hamburg in honour
                        of the Scottish poet Robert Burns (born January 25, 1759). At the restaurant “Alter Heidkrug” we enjoy an evening with our guests sharing Scottish food and Scottish music.</p>

                    <p>Our musical year also includes the event “Music from Scotland”, founded in 1987 by our honorary member and glass sculptor Uwe Fossemer in Itzstedt, Schleswig-Holstein. This evening unites musicians from all over Germany who come together
                        for joy and music without making any money and the proceeds are benefited to Schulverein Nahe. In 2017 we celebrated with more than 50 musicans the 30th Jubilee of that event. As the "house band" we are especially happy that the
                        venue will contiune from 2018 under new guidance. In addition to our training sessions, which serve the common learning and playing of the Scottish bagpipe and drum music, many of our band members have also arranged additional
                        and individually organized training sessions- some at the Collage of Piping in Glasgow, Scotland. Furthermore we regularly organize practice weekends, to which we invite teachers from Scotland, to train us and to study new tunes.</p>

                    <p>Some members of the band have participated in competitions and recorded considerable placements and reviews. If you are interested to hear from us from time to time, please subscribe to our newsletter, which we distribute by email
                        at irregular intervals. As we train our young Talents ourselves, we always look forward to those who are interested in taking part in a training session. Come and join us! Don’t hesitate to contact us. For further questions, please
